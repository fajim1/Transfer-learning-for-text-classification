# Transfer-learning-for-text-classification
Applying pre trained BERT for text classification on the health fact dataset from huggingface.

Downloading and running the Text Classification notebook should work just fine. The dataset for this task is directly loaded from huggingface within the notebook, but make sure that the [Huggingface Transformer](https://huggingface.co/transformers/installation.html) package and the [Huggingface Dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/installation.html) package are both installed
